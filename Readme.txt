Part 1: Improvements --------------------------------------------------------------------

-Everything has been textured now
-Several bug fixes
-Added vignette for style
-Added Lens Flares
-Added Particles
-Added Outline Shader

Part 2: Texturing --------------------------------------------------------------------=

Every environment surface, such as the walls and floor for each room, have now been textured
The textures were created:
-Downloading from AmbientCG
-Changing each part of the texture to only be 64x64 pixels
-Removed Anti-aliasing
-Imported them into the game and turned their Tiling scale to 0.2

This makes for interesting looking textures that still match the asthetics. They work really well with the dither shader to give a pixelated feel
